**Task Summary**: Breast Cancer Analysis with Python As a Data Analyst, I will work with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The key tasks include:

- Data Loading & Exploration: Load the dataset, inspect its structure, check for missing values, and verify data types.
- Dataset Overview: Display sample rows, check dataset dimensions and store column names for reference.
- Data Analysis: Count and visualize the distribution of benign vs. malignant tumors using bar charts.
- Data Segmentation: Separate benign and malignant cases into different datasets for deeper analysis.
- Statistical Insights: Compute key statistics (max, min, mean, median, standard deviation) for tumor radius.
- Data Visualization:
  - Scatter plot of radius vs. perimeter.
  - Scatter plot of radius vs. perimeter, highlighting malignant tumors in red and benign tumors in blue.
  - Scatter plot of concave points vs. smoothness.
  - Scatter plot of concave points vs. smoothness, using the same color coding as above.

This analysis aims to uncover tumor characteristics patterns and help understand key relationships between variables.
